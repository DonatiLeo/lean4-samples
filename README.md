# lean4-samples
Code samples for Lean 4.

## Get started

In order to run these samples you need a working Lean 4 environment.
See [Quickstart](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/quickstart.html)
instructions on how to set that up.

## Use Gitpod

You can also use [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/) to browse these samples and it will setup a
working Lean 4 environment for you.  Start by pointing your browser at
[https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/leanprover/lean4-samples](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/leanprover/lean4-samples)
then when lean is installed use File/Open Folder... to open the sample that you want to play with.

## Hello world

Every language needs a [simple hello world sample](HelloWorld/readme.md).

## Guess My Number

Explore more standard input processing with a [simple guess-my-number game](GuessMyNumber/Readme.md).

## CSV Parser

[CSV parser](CSVParser/README.md) is the simplest practical CSV parser you can write in Lean.

## Rubik's cube

[Rubik's cube](RubiksCube/README.md) is an example showing how to build custom [user widgets](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/examples/widgets.lean.html)
for the InfoView using TypeScript and Lake. Given a sequence of moves, it renders a Rubik's cube
in 3D which can be animated with the movement of a slider.
